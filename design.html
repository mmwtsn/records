      <h3>Development Methodology</h3>
      <p>Records was developed using behavior-driven development. Allowing tests to guide my app development prevents me from writing more code than is necessary by walking me step by step through the current requirements needed to create a small piece of functionality. Having tests also helps to prevent future bugs as application code changes and is reorganized throughout the development process. In particular, I find that behavior-driven development helps me walk through the development process from a user's perspective which often simplifies the daunting task of building a new application into digestible pieces. I tend to prefer this methodology to purely test-driven development as it is the integration of application components that tend to break most often. If interested, a good talk on the subject was delivered at RailsConf 2013 called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9md-GTF_Th8">Delicious Controversy</a>.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>Records was built using a fairly common Rails stack on the server side: Ruby 2.1, Rails 4.1, MySQL. For testing, I used RSpec as I find it lines up with how I think about writing tests. Atop RSpec sits Capybara a library  that makes integration testing incredibly simple thanks to a set of methods that intelligibly mock user interactions ("visit", "click", etc.). As RSpec and Capybara run Ruby and JavaScript processes separately, I included Capybara-Webkit to allow for a headless Webkit driver to run alongside my test suite to ensure any integration tests relying on AJAX or a JavaScript-triggered DOM update will pass successfully without needing to annoyingly launch browser windows with each pass through the test suite.</p>

      <p>On the front-end, I used jQuery to simplify DOM interaction and SASS for CSS preprocessing. I also installed a set of SASS libraries from Thoughtbot called <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> to provide some default styles and put a framework in place for my SASS.</p>

      <h3>User Experience</h3>
      <p>My focus for the user experience was creating a simple, easy to use app that wasn't overly laden with features. To achieve this, the app exists primarily in a single view and most interactions with the server are handled via AJAX so that the user does not need to leave the page unless they are viewing more information about a saved record in their collection. I elected to separate this view as it makes a call to Discogs for additional information about that specific release and I wanted to prevent the page from making too many API requests from a single view. Breaking out the records#show view came with the added benefit of simplifying the test sutie somewhat.</p>

      <p>Visually, I focused on creating a clean, minimal interface that displayed only as much information as needed. I opted for a dark color scheme as it's often night time when I am home listening to my records. For the typography, I chose the ubiquitous Open Sans and am serving it from Google Fonts.</p>
